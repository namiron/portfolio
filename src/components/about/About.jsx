Hi! I am a front-end developer specializing in building web 
                        applications and websites using React.js.
                        I started learning web development at university.
                        Out of all the subjects I studied, web development was my favorite,
                        so I decided to continue learning this field.

                    <div className={aboutStyles.imgFirst}>
                        <img src={inarmy} alt="inarmy" />
                    </div>
                </div>

Since graduating, I have gained extensive experience, including working as a freelancer.
                        I have collaborated with various teams and utilized different technologies to achieve project goals. 
                        Although my formal education was completed some time ago,
                        I continue to strive for growth by regularly upgrading my skills through courses and ongoing learning.
